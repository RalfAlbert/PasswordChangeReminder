<p><strong>Settings for the Password Changing Reminder</strong></p>
<h3>Main Settings</h3>
<h4>Interval</h4>
<p>Set the interval a password is at least  to be changed. The interval can be set in days, weeks, months and years.<br>
However, please note that the plugin converts the units "weeks", "months" and "years" internally in days.
Thus, for example, will three months convert internally into 90 days. Months with 31 or 28 days are not taken into account. This
means that 4 weeks (4x7 days = 28 days) are not the same as 1 month (30 days). This can cause that the reminder is displayed a few days earlier or later as expected. A more accurate calculation is possibly implemented in a later version.<br>
The conversion is done with the following values​​:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weeks: 7 days (e.g.: 3 weeks will be converted to 21 days)</li>
<li>Month: 30 days (e.g.: 3 months will be converted to 90 days)</li>
<li>Year: 365 days (e.g.: 3 years will be converted to 1095 days)</li>
</ul>
